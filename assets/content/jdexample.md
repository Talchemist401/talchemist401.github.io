# Founding Staff Data Scientist â€“ AI Talent Transformation

## Why Talchemist Exists

Simon Sinekâ€™s *Start with Why* reminds us that the most successful companies donâ€™t just build productsâ€”they solve fundamental problems by starting with a clear **why**.

**Hereâ€™s our why: Recruiting is broken.**

Every hiring process starts with assumptions, early searches, and generic outreachâ€”yet the real insights emerge later in the process. The hiring panel learns exactly what the perfect candidate looks like, but those insights never feed back into sourcing, outreach, or interview structures.

**The result? A static process in a dynamic world.**

Talchemist was built to fix this. Our **Recursive Recruitingâ„¢ engine** continuously refines hiring by capturing insights at every step. Instead of starting from scratch each time, our AI-driven approach ensures that every interaction makes the next one better.

Weâ€™re looking for a **Founding Staff Data Scientist** to build the AI backbone of a system that learns and evolves.

## What Youâ€™ll Do

- **Architect & build the Recursive Recruitingâ„¢ engine.** Develop AI models that structure, analyze, and refine hiring intelligence in real time.
- **Power the AI hiring assistant.** Create real-time recommendations and insights for recruiters.
- **Scale the system.** Build and optimize real-time data pipelines and AI infrastructure to handle millions of hiring interactions.
- **Experiment & iterate.** Deploy LLM-based insights, voice-driven automation, and predictive analytics to continuously refine our AI.

## Who You Are

- **Full ownership mindset.** You love building things, not just analyzing them.
- **Real-time systems expertise.** Youâ€™ve worked with streaming data, event-driven architectures, and large-scale ML systems.
- **LLM & NLP Enthusiast.** You experiment with LLMs, hang out on Hugging Face, and stay up to date with Deepgram, Whisper, or real-time transcription tech.
- **Production-grade machine learning.** You can build, deploy, and optimize models in production.
- **Data pipeline wizardry.** You know how to move, transform, and structure data for AI-driven hiring.

## Compensation & Early-Stage Flexibility

As an early-stage startup, weâ€™re open to structuring compensation in a way that works for both of us:

- **Equity-Heavy (Founding Team-Level Ownership)** â€“ Take on significant equity with a minimal salary.
- **Equity + Profit Sharing Model** â€“ A balanced approach where you receive equity plus a share of company profits once we hit revenue milestones.

## Why This Role Matters

You wonâ€™t just be writing codeâ€”youâ€™ll be defining how AI transforms hiring. Our **Recursive Recruitingâ„¢ process** is patent-pending, and as our first engineering hire, youâ€™ll shape the technology that sets a new standard for AI-powered talent acquisition.
